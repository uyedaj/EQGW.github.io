   <strong>We are pleased to announce the 2025 Evolutionary Quantitative Genetics Workshop (EQG25) at a new 
    location, scenic Mountain Lake Biological Station in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains! </strong>  
    This workshop has been given yearly since 2011-2019 and virtually in 2021-2022 under 
    the leadership of Joe Felsenstein and Stevan J Arnold. Steve and Joe have stepped down as leads and we are 
    bringing back this years' with new lead instructors Dr. Josef Uyeda and Dr. Fabio Machado. Dr. Felsenstein will
    participate virtually, and along with several other instructors.

  <h2>Workshop Description</h2>
  <p>The workshop will teach evolutionary frameworks for studying trait
  evolution from micro to macroevolutionary scales. We will cover the
  basics of theory in the field of evolutionary quantitative genetics in
  microevolutionary studies before transitioning to teaching phylogenetic
  comparative methods for studying trait evolution over macroevolutionary
  scales. Our primary aims are to build bridges between the traditionally
  separate disciplines of quantitative genetics and comparative methods,
  contextualize each others research in the outstanding questions across
  scales, and learn cutting edge computational methods of analysis.</p>

  <p>Quantitative genetic theory for natural populations was developed
  considerably in the period from 1970 up to the present, and it has been
  applied to a wide range of phenomena including the evolution of life
  history traits, plasticity of traits, mating preferences, as well as the
  evolution of body size and other morphological measurements.
  Phylogenetic approaches to comparative biology were developed from the
  1980s on, including inferring how traits covary in evolution and how
  optimum values of traits vary between species. Textbooks have been slow
  to cover these developments, and currently few universities offer
  courses on these subjects aimed at evolutionary biologists.</p>
  <p>Evolutionary biologists need to understand this field because of the
  ability to collect large amounts of data, the development of statistical
  methods for changes of traits on evolutionary trees and for changes in a
  single species through time, and the realization that quantitative
  characters will not soon be fully explained by genomics. This workshop
  aims to fill this need by reviewing basic aspects of theory and
  illustrating how that theory can be tested with data, both from single
  species and from multiple-species phylogenies. Participants will receive
  hands on experience with methods and datasets to build and test
  evolutionary models, primarily using R, an open-source statistical
  programming language.</p>
  <p>Please note carefully that this is not a workshop on numerical,
  statistical, or computational methods for reconstructing phylogenies,
  nor does it cover molecular genomics. This workshop will be primarily of
  interest to those studying trait evolution and interested in how their
  work and the work of others connects across scales.</p>
  <p>The workshop involves lectures, discussions and in-class computer
  exercises. The site you are on right now has a schedule of lectures, computer labs, and discussions. 
  It also has pages for each of these sessions, containing lecture projections, notes, and computer exercises. 
  <strong>*Currently these are mostly the materials for 2022 and will be updated as we approach the 2025 workshop.*</strong>

  <h2>Workshop History</h2>
  <p>This workshop has been given yearly since 2011-2019 and virtually in
  2021-2022 under the leadership of Joe Felsenstein and Stevan J Arnold.
  Steve and Joe have had to take a step back in organizing the workshop,
  but we will rely heavily on the groundwork they have built for this
  course. In addition, Dr. Felsenstein will join us virtually for part of
  the workshop and students will have an opportunity to talk with him
  virtually. This workshop was initially held at NESCENT in Durham, NC;
  NiMBIOS in Knoxville, TN, and most recently in Friday Harbor Labs on San
  Juan Island in Washington. We are bringing back this years’ workshop to
  be held at scenic Mountain Lake Biological Station in the heart of the
  Appalachian Mountains. Lead instructor Josef Uyeda initially TA’d this
  workshop as a graduate student, before transitioning to a full
  instructor, and has been present at every iteration of the workshop
  except one.</p>
  <p>Here are links to previous years’ workshops, with pages for the
  individual lectures, including lecture projections, audio recordings,
  and files for computer exercises.</p>
